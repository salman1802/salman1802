## 📝 Blog

I occasionally write about web development, Laravel, and other tech-related topics. Here are some of my recent blog posts:

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

I'm constantly exploring new technologies and tools. Currently, I'm focused on:

- Learning Serverless tech - Serverless technology, also known as serverless computing, is a cloud computing paradigm that abstracts away the management of server infrastructure, allowing developers to focus solely on writing and deploying code.
- Experimenting with AWS server stuff.
